# Proposals Best Practices


## Naming
The directory of the proposal should lead with a 4-digit PR number (will move to 5,6,... should our PR count get that high), followed by kebab-cased title. The PR number is not known until the PR is cut, so development can use a placeholder, ex. XXXX-my-proposal. PR number is used b/c it is unique & chronological, allowing the default ordering of proposals to follow the timeline of development.
