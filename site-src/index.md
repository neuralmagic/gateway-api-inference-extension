# Introduction

Gateway API Inference Extension is an official Kubernetes project focused on
extending [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) with inference
specific routing extensions.

The overall resource model focuses on 2 new inference-focused
[personas](/concepts/roles-and-personas) and corresponding resources that
they are expected to manage:

## Key Features 
Gateway API Inference Extension, along with a reference implementation in Envoy Proxy, provides the following key features: 

- **Model-aware routing**: Instead of simply routing based on the path of the request, Gateway API Inference Extension allows you to route to models based on the model names. This is enabled by support for GenAI Inference API specifications (such as OpenAI API) in the gateway implementations such as in Envoy Proxy. This model-aware routing also extends to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuned models.

- **Serving priority**: Gateway API Inference Extension allows you to specify the serving priority of your models. For example, you can specify that your models for online inference of chat tasks (which is more latency sensitive) have a higher [*Criticality*](/reference/spec/#criticality) than a model for latency tolerant tasks such as a summarization. 

- **Model rollouts**:  Gateway API Inference Extension allows you to incrementally roll out new model versions by traffic splitting definitions based on the model names. 

- **Extensibility for Inference Services**: Gateway API Inference Extension defines extensibility pattern for additional Inference services to create bespoke routing capabilities should out of the box solutions not fit your needs.


- **Customizable Load Balancing for Inference**: Gateway API Inference Extension defines a pattern for customizable load balancing and request routing that is optimized for Inference. Gateway API Inference Extension provides a reference implementation of model endpoint picking leveraging metrics emitted from the model servers. This endpoint picking mechanism can be used in lieu of traditional load balancing mechanisms. Model Server-aware load balancing ("smart" load balancing as its sometimes referred to in this repo) has been proven to reduce the serving latency and improve utilization of accelerators in your clusters.

## Composable Layers

This project aims to define specifications to enable a compatible ecosystem for
extending the Gateway API with custom endpoint selection algorithms. This
project defines a set of patterns across three distinct layers of components
that are relevant to this project:

### Gateway API Implementations

Gateway API has [more than 25
implementations](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/). As this
pattern stabilizes, we expect a wide set of these implementations to support
this project.

### Endpoint Selection Extension

As part of this project, we're building an initial reference extension. Over
time, we hope to see a wide variety of extensions emerge that follow this
pattern and provide a wide range of choices.

### Model Server Frameworks

This project will work closely with model server frameworks to establish a
shared standard for interacting with these extensions, particularly focused on
metrics and observability so extensions will be able to make informed routing
decisions. The project is currently focused on integrations with
[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and
[Triton](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server), and will be open to
other integrations as they are requested.

## Request Flow

To illustrate how this all comes together, it may be helpful to walk through a
sample request.

1. The first step involves the Gateway selecting the correct InferencePool
(set of endpoints running a model server framework) or Service to route to. This
logic is based on the existing Gateway and HTTPRoute APIs, and will be familiar
to any Gateway API users or implementers.

2. If the request should be routed to an InferencePool, the Gateway will forward
the request information to the endpoint selection extension for that pool.

3. The extension will fetch metrics from whichever portion of the InferencePool
endpoints can best achieve the configured objectives. Note that this kind of
metrics probing may happen asynchronously, depending on the extension.

4. The extension will instruct the Gateway which endpoint the request should be
routed to.

5. The Gateway will route the request to the desired endpoint.
