# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# vLLM Deployment
#
# This deploys the full vLLM model server, capable of serving real models such
# as Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct via the OpenAI-compatible API. It is intended for
# environments with GPU resources and where full inference capabilities are
# required.
#
# The deployment can be customized using environment variables to set:
#   - The container image and tag (VLLM_IMAGE, VLLM_TAG)
#   - The model to load (MODEL_NAME)
#
# This setup is suitable for testing on Kubernetes (including
# GPU-enabled nodes or clusters with scheduling for `nvidia.com/gpu`).
